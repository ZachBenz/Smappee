# Overview

The Autolog smappee Controller is a plugin for version 6+ of the [Indigo Home Automation system][1]. It enables you to interact with [smappee][2] devices directly from Indigo.

The Smappee is a device that is physically connected to an electricity consumer unit / PV Inverter to measure electricity usage (consumption) and solar generation. Its unique selling point is that it is able to detect when individual appliances switch on and off by detecting their "electrical signatures". It can also monitor gas and water usage. It can control wireless actuators (plugs). It communicates wirelessly with the Smappee "cloud" server to download electricity usage, solar generation, gas/water usage and appliance information and actuator states.

T
It is **strongly recommended** to read the [Smappee documentation][3] and [Smappee Discussion thread][4] to familiarise yourself with the how the plugin works. The documenation will be updated and migrated to the Github Wiki in due course.
